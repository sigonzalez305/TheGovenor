Architecture notes for the DC Internet Listener live in `docs/dc_internet_listener.md`. Start there for sources, data model, ingestion pipeline, classification rules, and UI screen map.

If you need to build and ship the web app, use `docs/web_app_build_guide.md` for a Vite/React implementation plan, component layout, API contracts, and deployment/testing pointers.
